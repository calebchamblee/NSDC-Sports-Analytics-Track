# NSDC-Sports-Analytics-Track
NBA injury prediction and cricket match prediction in the sports analytics track for Tufts NSDC spring 2026.

**NBA Project Overview:**

This project explores how player characteristics and in-game workload relate to injury risk in the NBA. Using player demographic data, game exposure, and contextual features, we aim to understand which factors are most strongly associated with injuries.

**Cricket Project Overview:**

Analyze match-level cricket data to understand which contextual factors (teams, venue, toss, season, etc.) are associated with winning a match. The project is BI-first, with light, interpretable ML.
